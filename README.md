# 🧙‍♀️🔮EmotionClassifierAI

This project fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT-based model (`bert-base-uncased`) to classify text spells into emotional categories such as joy, sadness, anger, and more. 🪄✨

## 🧪 Techniques & Tools Used
- Fine-tuned the base model (bert-base-uncased) using a custom emotion-labeled dataset 🧾
- Compared predictions between the fine-tuned model and the vanilla base model 🔍
- Used Hugging Face 🤗 Transformers and Datasets to brew and test the model 🧰
- Measured accuracy and visualized predictions side by side for comparison 🔮

## ✨ Emotional Runes (Classified Emotions)
- 😢 **Sadness** (0)
- 😄 **Joy** (1)
- 💖 **Love** (2)
- 😠 **Anger** (3)
- 😨 **Fear** (4)
- 😲 **Surprise** (5)
